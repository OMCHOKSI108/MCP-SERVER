4. Data Analysis and Reporting Agent
Concept: An AI agent that can query databases and generate reports.
Backend (Your MCP Server):
Database Tool: Provide a secure, read-only connection to a PostgreSQL or MySQL database.[10] The tool would allow the agent to execute SQL queries.
Data Visualization Tool: Integrate with a library like Matplotlib or Plotly to generate charts and graphs based on query results.
Email/Slack Tool: Create a tool that allows the agent to send the generated reports via email or as a message in a Slack channel.[4]
Agent Interaction: You could request, "Get the total sales for the last quarter, generate a bar chart, and send it to the #sales channel on Slack."
5. Web Scraping and Information Gathering Agent
Concept: An agent that can browse the web to find and summarize information.
Backend (Your MCP Server):
Web Scraping Tool: Use a library like BeautifulSoup or Puppeteer to create a tool that can fetch the content of a webpage.[10]
Search Tool: Integrate with a search API (like Brave Search) to allow the agent to perform web searches.[10]
Agent Interaction: You could ask, "What are the top 5 news headlines on BBC News right now?" The agent would use the web scraping tool to get the information and summarize it for you.
